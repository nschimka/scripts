# Solution for a (very silly) lab I wrote on conditionals in Bash.
# The silliness is meant to emphasize that Bash relies on the same commands you'd run in the CLI

# The lab

# Declare a variable to represent what day it is. (Bonus: ask the user what day it is and store that in a variable). 
# If today is Monday, create the user 'leia'; do not create a home directory for her and do not create a 'leia' group. 
# If today is Wednesday, search in /usr/share/dict/words for the word "defenestration;" if it's not there, print out 
# a message saying it's not there. If today is Thursday, create 20 files named saber1.jpg, saber2.jpg, etc. in the 
# /home/student/jediweapons directory. Otherwise, update all software packages to the newest version.
# Hint: You only need to create the directory if it doesnâ€™t exist. Check here for more conditional expressions.

# Solution

#!/bin/bash 
echo "What day is it today?" 
read today 
if [ "$today" = "Monday" ]; then 
  useradd -M -N leia 
elif [ "$today" = "Wednesday" ]; then 
  if ! grep 'defenestration' /usr/share/dict/words; then 
    echo "defenestration is not in the dictionary" 
  fi 
elif [ "$today" = "Thursday" ]; then 
  if [ ! -d /home/student/jediweapons ]; then 
    mkdir /home/student/jediweapons 
  fi 
  touch /home/student/jediweapons/saber{1..20}.jpg 
else 
  yum update 
fi
