# Solution to a lab I wrote on doing arithmetic with let in Bash

# The lab

# Ask for a number from the user and use it to calculate The Magic Number©. Here's how you calculate it:
# 1) If it's an even number, add 50 to it. If it's an odd number, subtract 50 from it. 
# Hint: you can use the modulo operator to determine if it's odd or even, described here: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ops.html
# 2) If the number is less than 0, keep adding 8 to it until it's a positive number. Otherwise, multiply it by 1183
# 3) Raise it to the 6th power
# 4) Divide it by 327
# 5) Pause the program for 10 seconds to make it seem like it's doing intense calculations
# 6) Throw away all your previous calculations and set it equal to 42
# 7) Print out that the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is The Magic Number©, 42. 
# Print out the 42 using the variable name instead of 42.

# The solution

#!/bin/bash
