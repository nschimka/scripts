# Solution to a lab I wrote on variables in Bash

# The lab
# Store the current date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) into a variable and print it out to the command line with a 
# descriptive message, like “The current date is: .“ Count the number of files inside / and print that out 
# with a descriptive message as well.

# Solution

#!/bin/bash 
today=$(date +%F) 
echo "Today's date is: " $today 
num_files=$(ls / | wc -l) 
echo "There are" $num_files "files inside /"
