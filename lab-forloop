# Solution to a lab I wrote on for loops in Bash

# The lab

# Write a script to simulate a rocket countdown by printing 10 to liftoff on the command line. 
# What kind of loop should you write?

# The solution

#!/bin/bash 
for i in {10..0}; do 
  echo $i 
  sleep 1 
  if [ "$i" -eq 0 ]; then 
    echo "liftoff!!!" 
  fi
