# Solution to a lab I wrote on while loops in Bash

# The lab

# Write a script that keeps asking you for a number between 1 and 10 until you guess it. 
# To keep things simple, this number is an arbitrary value that you set in a variable. 
# What kind of loop should you write?

# Hint: you can use the break statement to get out of an endless loop.
# Bonus: Give hints based on guesses on how close they are to the answer.
# Additional Bonus: Go to http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/randomvar.html to find out how you can generate a pseudorandom number.

# The solution

#!/bin/bash 
max=10 
number=$((RANDOM%max)) 
while true; do 
  echo "guess a number between 0 and $max" 
  read guess 
  if [ "$guess" = "$number" ]; then 
    echo "yay you got it!" 
    break 
  elif [ "$guess" -lt "$number" ]; then 
    echo "your guess was too low" 
  else 
    echo "your guess was too high" 
  fi 
done
